            <h1>Sewer Dwarf</h1>
            <p>
                There is a dry sewer by the side of the road with weeds and no running water.
                The sewer is old and has no lid in some places.
                When you look inside, you find juice cans and cigarette butts.
                Sometimes there are flowers without lids, the names of which are unknown.
                Elementary school students often pass that sewer as they walk to school.
                It is dark inside, and it is hard to tell how far it goes.
                She walked along the sewer as if tracing its path.

            <h2>Dwarf in excavation</h2>
            <p>
                One day, as she was walking along the path to school where that sewer is located, she saw a green hat at
                the edge of the sewer.
                She first thought it was a plastic bottle cap because it was small.
                But upon closer inspection, she saw it was moving.
                Upon closer inspection, she saw that it was a dwarf wearing a green hat.
                He picked up a marble that had fallen nearby and retreated into the sewer.
                When she approached, no one was there.

        <h2>Her imagination</h2>
        <p>
            She thought the sewers must be full of treasures.
            Gold coins and lame cards.
            Maybe even some money.
            Maybe the dwarves often roam the sewers to unearth the treasures.
            They put ladders on high places and light lamps in dark places.
            But they don't want people to find them, so they work in secret.
            She stopped peeking into the sewers so often for the dwarfs.
